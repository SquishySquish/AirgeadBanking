Airgead Banking Application for CS210- Programming Languages

This project makes an interactive banking application for a user to check how much they can make from starting a bank account that accrues interest monthly for whatever duration that they so choose to leave their amount of money they invest per month or just the interest that their investment makes each month.

It is a good way to show that looping until the user issues a command to quit and that I have the ability to format an output to make it look moderately nice even in a console session. It would be easily adaptable to a more modern method such as an actual application.

I had very little trouble with this, as the calculations for the interest were relatively easy and the only thing that took a bit longer than the rest was making sure that I properly output the right amount of interest for each iteration of the loop where I added it and then incremented again.

The skills displayed in this project are very helpful in the fact that they show that this project could have been made to be even more complex or even tied to another process entirely, just based on the formatting and consistent data.

This program is easy to maintain as it just has the singular function included. If you wanted something more complex like the ability to take out money or be able to give an instruction to change the amount of investment at a certain time, that could also be very easily added to this project.
